# Lab.js Audio Recording Demo
 
This is a demo experiment, showing how to make audio recordings in a [lab.js](https://lab.js.org/) experiment. It is inspired by a script by [Kwame Porter Robinson](https://github.com/robinsonkwame/lab-js-recording-task) and [Mozilla's Media Recording API tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStream_Recording_API/Using_the_MediaStream_Recording_API)


On each trial ahudio is recorded from the microphone using the [MediaRecorderAPI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaRecorder). There's two types of trials:

- trial with a record button (optional, the recorded clip can be shown on the page). This can be used for testing audio or when timing is not critical
- trial without a record button that starts automatically and ends when the user presses a key. The key can be configured. The trial automatically progressing to the next trial after key press.

On the last screen, the data is downloaded as a `.csv` file, with the audio encoded as Base64 strings in the `audio` column. Base64 strings can be converted to individual audio files using a Python/R/JavaScript script or a website such as https://base64.guru/. 
## Gotcha's

- The Base64 string cannot be directly decoded as Base64 without first removing the Data-URL declaration preceding the Base64-encoded data. That is, remove the following part from the string: `data:audio/ogg; codecs=opus;base64,`. 
- Excel is struggling with the Base64 encoded data, because it can easily exceed the character limit for a cell. If you open this file in Excel it might add unwanted linebreaks / rows. Better open it in a text exitor like VSCode or R. 
- Once extracted, the filetype of the audio is `.ogg`. Not all media players can play ogg files. â€‹[VLC](https://www.videolan.org/) is a good free audio player that can play ogg.
